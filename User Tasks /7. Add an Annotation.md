**7. Add an Annotation**

An annotation on ARCS means a relation to another resource within or outside of the ARCS project. If while viewing a resource you would like to create this relation, you can annotate the resource so others can also view the relationships this resource has.

1. Select **Annotate** from the tray above the resource you are viewing.

![7.1 Annotated](../images/User%20Tasks%20Annotated/7.1_annotated.png?raw=true)

2. This will change the viewer to allow you to create a box around the space you would like to annotate by clicking the resource directly and dragging your mouse.

![7.2 Annotated](../images/User%20Tasks%20Annotated/7.2_annotated.png?raw=true)

3. Once you have completed the box, there will be a pop-up where you can **search a relation** to relate the resource to other documents on the ARCS project. This works the same as a keyword search on ARCS and will pull up resources from across the project for you to select.

![7.3 Annotated](../images/User%20Tasks%20Annotated/7.3_annotation.png?raw=true)

4. The pop-up window also has a location where you can **enter a URL.** This can be the stable URL of a resource in your ARCS project or an outside URL that relates to the resource.

![7.4 Annotated](../images/User%20Tasks%20Annotated/7.4_annotated.png?raw=true)

5. Once you have selected a resource or entered a URL, click **Create Annotation** to save the annotation.
