**15. Add Resources to an Existing Collection**

If you find a resource that you would like to add to a collection you have already created, there are two way to do so:

Bulk Selection:

1. While viewing multiple resources in either a collection or in a resource type, you can select multiple at a time by clicking the **circle in the top left corner** of the resource.
