**12. Request Access to Project**

As a researcher on ARCS you may run across projects that you do not have access to. If you find a project that sounds interesting and you would like to participate in, you can request access to it in a few simple steps.

To request access to a project,

1. Navigate to a user profile of a researcher on the project you want access to.
