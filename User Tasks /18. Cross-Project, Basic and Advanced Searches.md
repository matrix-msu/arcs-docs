You can do a Cross-Project Search to find resources across projects with a simple Keyword Search starting from the ARCS main landing page.

a. Note that when entering multiple words, the Keyword Search will generate results where *all* words in the search are present in *any* of the fields. Click the circled question mark next to Keyword Search for more information about this process and specific help with searching dates.

2. This will bring you to the Keyword Search with results from all projects on ARCS.

Advanced Cross-Project Search:
