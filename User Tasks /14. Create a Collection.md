**14. Create a Collection**

As a researcher in ARCS, you can create Collections to group and save resources you find on the site. There are published to your profile and other users have the ability to search for and use your collections. There are two channels through which you can make a collection.

Bulk selection:

1. While viewing an entire collection or resource type, click the **top left corner** of the resource(s) to select multiple at a time.
