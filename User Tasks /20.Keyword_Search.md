**Keyword Search**

For those seeking to gain a more general sense of the resources within a project or across projects, a Keyword Search is recommended.

Keyword Searches query only 13 of all the possible fields that describe resources in the ARCS system. They are as follows.

RESOURCE SCHEME -- focuses on 1 archival **Resource** (document, map, photograph, etc.) created during the archaeological field research process

Resource Title

Resource Identifier 

Resource Type

Earliest Date of Resource

Latest Date of Resource

Accession/Catalog Number(s)

SUBJECT OF OBSERVATION SCHEME -- focuses on the archeological item that is the **topic of study** in the archival document

Artifact / Structure

Classification Artifact / Structure

Type Artifact / Structure

Material Manufacturing Technique Artifact / Structure

Period Earliest Possible Date of Artifact / Structure

Latest Possible Date of Artifact / Structure

Searches involving lists or terms will generate results only all when all terms are present among these fields. For example, a search for “Roman lamp” will return records where both "Roman" **AND** "lamp" appear in the Resource Title **OR** Resource Identifier **OR** Artifact / Structure Type **OR** Artifact / Structure Period, etc.

__To search dates, enter the data as follows__

Complete year (e.g. 1972 and not 72)

Month and year (e.g. March 1972 and not 3/1972)

Full date in year, month, day format (e.g. 1972/03/15 and not 3/15/72)

Results of a Keyword search can be filtered according to Season, Resource Type, Excavation Units and Creator. For specific definitions of these expressions, consult the ARCSCore Metadata Scheme [https://github.com/matrix-msu/ARCSCore/wiki]

Note too that searching across projects in ARCS is currently only possible by means of a Keyword Search.
