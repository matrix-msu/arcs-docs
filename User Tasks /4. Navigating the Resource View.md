**4. Navigating the Resource View**

The interface to view details about a resource is called the **Resource View.** This interface is packed with functionality so that ARCS users can best interact with both the resource and each other. There are three main components to this interface: The top tray, the interactive window, and the side tray.

The top tray of the Resource View provides options to work with the data in other locations.
