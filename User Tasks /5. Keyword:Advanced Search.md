**5. Keyword/Advanced Search**

There are types of search that can be done on the ARCS site within a project. the first type of search is a **Keyword Search.** This search uses the entered keyword(s) and searches across metadata and subject fields. An **Advanced Search** is the best way to find a specific resource on the ARCS site. This search uses narrower fields so it is best used to find a known resource rather than a general search. You can do a **Cross-Project Search** if you use the search bar from the ARCS landing page without first selecting a project. There is more information on this in the cross-project search information.

For a Keyword Search, you must first be within a project,

1. Click on the **Search** tab at the top of any page within the project.
