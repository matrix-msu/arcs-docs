**3. Navigating the collection view (what everything means/does in terms of layout)**

Each page of an ARCS project has a specific focus. These pages have functions that not only make it easier for you to use the resources within the project, but also for you to contribute to and edit the resources already in the project.

Project Landing Page:

The project landing page is the summary of the project. Here you can find the history and goals of the archaeological project, recent additions to the project by other resources and search bars for users and resources.

1. Click on the **Project** tab at the top of the website.

![3.0 Annotated](../images/User%20Tasks%20Annotated/3.0_annotated.2.png?raw=true)


2. At the top of this project landing page contains a brief description of the history and goals of the archaeological project.

![3.1 Annotated](../images/User%20Tasks%20Annotated/3.1_annotated.2.png?raw=true)


3. Underneath this project description you will find **Recently Added Resources.** Here resources are sorted by the date they were added rather than by type. To view more recently added than just those int he preview, click **Explore More Resources** at the bottom of the **Recently Added Resources** tab.

![3.2 Annotated](../images/User%20Tasks%20Annotated/3.2_annotated.2.png?raw=true)


4. Further down the **Project** page is a section of Recent Collections. Here there is a preview of recent collections made by other ARCS users within the project.

![3.3 Annotated](../images/User%20Tasks%20Annotated/3.3_annotated.2.png?raw=true)


5. Under the **Recent Collections**, there is a search bar to find other users involved in the ARCS project. If  you are not sure of who the other users are in the project, the search bar will have a drop-down that lists users in alphabetical order.

![3.4 Annotated](../images/User%20Tasks%20Annotated/3.4_annotated.png?raw=true)


6. At the bottom of the page there is a place to search resources across the entire project using a **Keyword Search**. There is more about performing a Keyword Search in the document about Keyword Searches, "Keyword/Advanced Search."

![3.5 Annotated](../images/User%20Tasks%20Annotated/3.5_annotated.png?raw=true)


On the Resources landing page, you will find all the resources in your project separated by resource type. This is a useful page to view for browsing specific types of resources that you do not have the keywords to search for.

1. Click on **Resources** to navigate to the Resources landing page.

![3.6 Annotated](../images/User%20Tasks%20Annotated/3.6_annotated.png?raw=true)

3. To view the objects within your specific type, simply click the **blue drop-down arrow** next tot the type title.

![3.8 Annotated](../images/User%20Tasks%20Annotated/3.8_annotations.png?raw=true)

![3.9 Annotated](../images/User%20Tasks%20Annotated/3.9_annotated.png?raw=true)


5. If you want to view all the resources of that type, click the **Show All** arrow at the bottom of the folder.

![3.10 Annotated](../images/User%20Tasks%20Annotated/3.10_annotated.png?raw=true)

6. By selecting an object, it will bring you to the **Resource View.**

7. You can either select an object directly from the resources landing page or by selecting more than one resource from the entire type if you are browsing a scientific resource type.

8. See "Navigating the Resource View" for more details on how to navigate this interface.

9. The bottom of the page provides a search bar to find resources within the project. This works the same way as a keyword search. See "Keyword/Advanced Search" for more information about how this type of search works on ARCS.

![3.11 Annotated](../images/User%20Tasks%20Annotated/3.11_annotated.png?raw=true)
